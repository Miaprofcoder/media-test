# social-media-api

## Description

- A back-end Social Media API powered by a MongoDB Database
- RESTful Api is capable of performing CRUD functions within the Social Media Database
- This web application helped me understand Non-relational Databases, along with some basic routings and functions within a social-media application from the back-end

1. Download or clone the repository. Extract and navigate to the project repository's path in your favorite terminal application.
2. In your terminal, type `npm i` to download all needed dependencies for the application.
3. After downloading all dependencies, you may want to seed your database with some sample data. To seed the sample data, type `node utils/seeds.js` in your terminal. Afterwards, you will see a `console.table` with the data seeded on your database.
4. Type `npm start` or `node server.js` to start the back-end server for API requests.
